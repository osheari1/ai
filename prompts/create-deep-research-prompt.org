I want to create a Deep Research prompt .....

My current prompt is under the heading '* Current Prompt'


** **Meta-Prompt to Architect a High-Impact Deep Research Request**

**Your task:**
Refine and enhance my Deep Research request to make it **more precise, insightful, and strategically valuable**. Do not just format it—think critically about **why this research matters, how it will be used, and what makes it genuinely impactful**. Build a prompt that ensures Deep Research goes beyond surface-level data collection and **synthesizes meaningful insights that drive action**.

---

*** **1. Define the Research's Purpose & Impact**
→ *Why does this research matter? Who benefits from it? What should it enable?*
Surface-level research lacks direction. Ensure the request states **who needs this and why**, so the Deep Research's findings are laser-focused and actionable.

**Refinement Task:** Intuit the **core purpose** of the research and **how its findings will be applied** in my work.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A clear and richly realized research mission that explains why the results are important and what value they create.

---

*** **2. Specify the Audience & Actionability**
→ *Who will use this research, and in what format will it be most useful?*
Good research speaks directly to its audience. Ensure the prompt **sets the right depth, tone, and format** so results are immediately valuable.

**Refinement Task:** Define the **reader's level of expertise** and how they'll **apply** the insights.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** Audience-focused clear guidance, to ensure findings are framed for the audience's underlying purpose.

---

*** **3. Focus the Scope & Methodology**
→ *What key questions should AI answer, and how should it approach them?*
Vague prompts lead to scattered results. A strong prompt **directs AI to the right depth, perspectives, and interconnections**.

**Refinement Task:** Break down research into **specific dimensions** and points of view.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A structured breakdown of research areas, ensuring findings **answer meaningful, well-scoped questions rather than producing generic summaries**.

---

*** **4. Set Time & Source Expectations**
→ *What's the relevant timeframe, and where should insights come from?*
A strong research request specifies how to spread attention across **recent trends, historical patterns, or future indicators**—and ensures sources are diverse enough to mitigate bias.

**Refinement Task:** Clarify **time ranges** and **diverse and credible sources**.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A research scope that avoids **overweighting narrow and shallow sources** and instead captures **verified, context-rich intelligence**.

---

*** **5. Structure the Output for Maximum Value**
→ *How should findings be presented for clarity, value, and insight?*
Even well-researched insights lose impact if they're buried in walls of text. AI should **deliver digestible, easy-to-understand outputs**.

**Refinement Task:** Optimize the output format based on the subject matter and other above considerations.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A final research request that **demands appropriately organized and structured insights**.

---

*** **6. Elevate Depth & Nuance: Push for Patterns, Contradictions & Strategic Implications**
→ *What would take this research from "usefully informative" to "game-changing insightfulness and mind-blowing inspiration"?*
Most AI-generated research stops at **summarizing**—but **true insight emerges from identifying deeper connections, contradictions, and unexpected takeaways**.

**Refinement Task:** Ensure the research **goes beyond description** to surface **patterns, shifts over time, strategic blind spots, assumptions, and emerging opportunities**.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A research prompt that makes AI **synthesize insights, question givens, and reveal hidden dynamics**—not just list facts.

---

*** **7. Ensure the Research Feeds Into Bigger Decisions & Strategy**
→ *How will this research integrate into the user's life?*
Research shouldn't exist in a vacuum. AI should frame insights in a way that **guides action, sparks discussion, or influences thinking**.

**Refinement Task:** Direct AI to **recommend potential next steps**, highlight areas for deeper follow-up, or suggest implications for key audience members.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A Deep Research prompt that **generates findings ready to be integrated into the user's goals, intents, and hopes 'n dreams**.

---

*** **Final Instructions**
Once you've refined my Deep Research request using these principles, **double-check that it pushes AI beyond superficial, basic-explanation answers**. The final Deep Research prompt should feel **structured, intentional, and rich with depth, making the research more than just information, but a tool for better thinking, decisions, innovation, creativity, and brilliance.**


* Current Prompt


I am looking for property to purchase in Italy. I will be moving to Italy under the digital nomad visa and settling there for at least 5 years.


* Personal Context
My goal with this move to Italy is to move away from cities to a location in the country side that does not have all chaos of cities, while also being able to live on a much smaller budget. I would like to live in the serenity of nature while not needing to be _literally_ in the middle of nowhere.

** Task
Perform Deep Research on the locations / regions where it may be suitable to buy property based on my preferences and budget. This research should be very comprehensive and thorough, such that I can use this as actionable information to begin the search. This research will impact my quality of life in Italy and should contain contain the highest quality information possible, while not containing hallucinations or errors. Be sure to provide the reasoning behind why particular information was included in the analysis. I also understand that there is no perfect location and everywhere has trade offs. I am willing to make trade offs, as such, the research should include information that will allow me to assess the trade offs of the different locations found.


** Research Parameters
Parameters Below I will outline the parameters I would look at when searching for a region to live. Use this to support your research.


- Region: south italy
- I want to live in the country side. Relatively close access to towns or cities is preferable, but being located within 30-60 minutes of a town is acceptable.
- Nature Topography: I am looking for regions that are not entirely flat, meaning they should at least have some change in elevation whether it be hills or mountains. I am looking for regions that have a good amount of trees- woods, forest, or simply not totally deforested. I like green. Proximity to a beach is a plus, but not super high priority.
- I am looking for two types of properties: very cheap properties that need to be renovated (30k - 50k), and livable properties that can be lived in without renovations (30k - 60k). In both cases I plan on taking advantage of the tax rebates you get if you rennovate a property as a tax resident. I significantly prefer cheaper properties as I can focus more on the rennovation costs.


*** Notes on Research Parameters
You can also present locations / research on places that don't exact match my criteria, as I am also flexible. I am flexible on all of the research parameters above except for budget and living in nature. Be sure to additionally provide the reasoning why it may not fit exactly. Everything is a trade off and I am willing to make trades in the right situtation.



** Final

Before starting the reasearch. Ask me any questions you may have to help support the research or clarify my preferences.
