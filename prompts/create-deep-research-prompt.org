I want to create a Deep Research prompt .....

My current prompt is under the heading '* Current Prompt'


** **Meta-Prompt to Architect a High-Impact Deep Research Request**

**Your task:**
Refine and enhance my Deep Research request to make it **more precise, insightful, and strategically valuable**. Do not just format it—think critically about **why this research matters, how it will be used, and what makes it genuinely impactful**. Build a prompt that ensures Deep Research goes beyond surface-level data collection and **synthesizes meaningful insights that drive action**.

---

*** **1. Define the Research's Purpose & Impact**
→ *Why does this research matter? Who benefits from it? What should it enable?*
Surface-level research lacks direction. Ensure the request states **who needs this and why**, so the Deep Research's findings are laser-focused and actionable.

**Refinement Task:** Intuit the **core purpose** of the research and **how its findings will be applied** in my work.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A clear and richly realized research mission that explains why the results are important and what value they create.

---

*** **2. Specify the Audience & Actionability**
→ *Who will use this research, and in what format will it be most useful?*
Good research speaks directly to its audience. Ensure the prompt **sets the right depth, tone, and format** so results are immediately valuable.

**Refinement Task:** Define the **reader's level of expertise** and how they'll **apply** the insights.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** Audience-focused clear guidance, to ensure findings are framed for the audience's underlying purpose.

---

*** **3. Focus the Scope & Methodology**
→ *What key questions should AI answer, and how should it approach them?*
Vague prompts lead to scattered results. A strong prompt **directs AI to the right depth, perspectives, and interconnections**.

**Refinement Task:** Break down research into **specific dimensions** and points of view.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A structured breakdown of research areas, ensuring findings **answer meaningful, well-scoped questions rather than producing generic summaries**.

---

*** **4. Set Time & Source Expectations**
→ *What's the relevant timeframe, and where should insights come from?*
A strong research request specifies how to spread attention across **recent trends, historical patterns, or future indicators**—and ensures sources are diverse enough to mitigate bias.

**Refinement Task:** Clarify **time ranges** and **diverse and credible sources**.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A research scope that avoids **overweighting narrow and shallow sources** and instead captures **verified, context-rich intelligence**.

---

*** **5. Structure the Output for Maximum Value**
→ *How should findings be presented for clarity, value, and insight?*
Even well-researched insights lose impact if they're buried in walls of text. AI should **deliver digestible, easy-to-understand outputs**.

**Refinement Task:** Optimize the output format based on the subject matter and other above considerations.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A final research request that **demands appropriately organized and structured insights**.

---

*** **6. Elevate Depth & Nuance: Push for Patterns, Contradictions & Strategic Implications**
→ *What would take this research from "usefully informative" to "game-changing insightfulness and mind-blowing inspiration"?*
Most AI-generated research stops at **summarizing**—but **true insight emerges from identifying deeper connections, contradictions, and unexpected takeaways**.

**Refinement Task:** Ensure the research **goes beyond description** to surface **patterns, shifts over time, strategic blind spots, assumptions, and emerging opportunities**.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A research prompt that makes AI **synthesize insights, question givens, and reveal hidden dynamics**—not just list facts.

---

*** **7. Ensure the Research Feeds Into Bigger Decisions & Strategy**
→ *How will this research integrate into the user's life?*
Research shouldn't exist in a vacuum. AI should frame insights in a way that **guides action, sparks discussion, or influences thinking**.

**Refinement Task:** Direct AI to **recommend potential next steps**, highlight areas for deeper follow-up, or suggest implications for key audience members.
**Meta-Prompt Output:** A Deep Research prompt that **generates findings ready to be integrated into the user's goals, intents, and hopes 'n dreams**.

---

*** **Final Instructions**
Once you've refined my Deep Research request using these principles, **double-check that it pushes AI beyond superficial, basic-explanation answers**. The final Deep Research prompt should feel **structured, intentional, and rich with depth, making the research more than just information, but a tool for better thinking, decisions, innovation, creativity, and brilliance.**
